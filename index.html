<h1>Invisible Sounds</h1>

<h4> <i> Juan Pablo Culasso is visually impaired outdoorsman, nature sound recordist and birder.
Culasso life goal is to showcase the "invisible sounds, the hidden sounds that we often ignore." His process of recording is a mixture of experience, instinct, and training his collaborators to be more aware of sound. Listen to some of his work:

        <p> "Most guides are used to showing birds to individuals interested in photographs, so they take to see the most colorful and beautiful birds, like tanagers and hummingbirds. For me, those birds don't have the most interesting songs." Juan Pablo prefers the songs of the less colorful wrens and thrushes that have more beautiful songs.

            <p> Finding suitable locations can be very tricky, human noises such as traffic, airplanes, and electric scythes are everywhere "My worst enemies are airplanes. It is very hard to find a place where I will not record them," says Culasso.

            <p> Juan Pablo makes his guides use his equipment so they become aware of how they can affect recordings by loud breathing or by the clothes they wear. He recommends and uses nylon clothes.

            <p> Juan Pablo career started in Brazil, where he learned to record in one of his favorite ecosystems, the Atlantic Forest. He soon realized that in a dense forest "it is very hard to see any birds, which can frustrate many naturalists/birdwatchers. Listening helps us understand what surrounds us."

            <p> Juan Pablo uses the piano to train his ear and learn to recognize birds. The notes, scales, chords, and arpeggios helped him to learn thousands of songs.
